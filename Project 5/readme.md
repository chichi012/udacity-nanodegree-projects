Flights Dataset

by Afamefuna Chidinma Deborah


Data Set

This project reports flights schedules in the United States and visualizes the key features in the dataset for on-time performance and explanations on why flights may be delayed. The data covers the range from January 2014 to May 2020.


Summary of Findings

From the bar plots, carrier delays and late aircraft delays had the highest impact on carriers arriving late. Arrival delay for all delay types had an average sum of 61903 minutes of dekay across the carriers.

The color graphs plotted showed the impact the delays due to carrier, NAS, late aircraft, and weather have on top carriers. Surprisingly, security and weather delays were not the strongest impacts on carrier delays as I initially suspected.

From the analysis of the color plots, carrier delays, NAS delays, and late aircrafts delays have the strongest impact on carriers with Southwest Airlines Co. [WN] being the most impacted airline.



Key Insights for Presentation

1. The airline carrier with the worst on-time performance record is Southwest Airlines Co. [WN]: Plots were made to show the relationship between the carrier and delay types.

2. The most prevalent reasons for delays are carrier delays, NAS delays, and late aircrafts delays due to their higher number of occrurence.
